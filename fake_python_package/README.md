# FakePackage

The FakePackage is a fake repository created to test three things.

On one hand, how ReadTheDocs performs when creating automated documentation.

On the other hand, how pip install works when submitting a package to Pipy, and installing locally.

Finally, to test compatibility within a docker container.

Welcome to the FakePackage repository !
